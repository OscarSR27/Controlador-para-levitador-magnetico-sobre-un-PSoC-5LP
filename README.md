# Description

Design and implementation of the control system for a magnetic levitation plant, which allows suspending a ferromagnetic sphere in the air at a specific height. 
Additionally, the control system is resistant to certain disturbances that can affect its operation, thereby ensuring that the sphere remains in the desired position.
